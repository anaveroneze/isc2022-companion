* Introduction

Companion Material for the paper ``Understanding Distributed Deep
Learning Performance by Correlating HPC and Machine Learning
Measurements'', by Ana Luisa Veroneze Solórzano and Lucas Mello 
Schnorr. Approved for the ISC High Performance 2022.

You can clone this repository with the following command:
#+begin_src shell :session *shell* :results output :exports both 
git clone https://gitlab.com/anaveroneze/isc22-companion.git
#+end_src

- The [[./img]] directory contains the expected Figures for our code
  snippets
- The [[./output/final.tar.gz]] file contains all dataset obtained with
  experiments for Horovod and Tarantella used to this analysis
- The [[./scripts]] directory contains the code snippets used to our
  performance analysis and generate the figures

* Requirements

The code and data manipulation were written in the R programming
language using the [[https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/tidyverse/][tidyverse]], a collection of R packages for data
science.

We use the [[https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/cowplot/][cowplot]] package to combine multiple ggplots into the same
graphic, the [[https://dbi.r-dbi.org/][DBI]] package to manipulate SQLite files, [[https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ggforce/][ggforce]] for
zooming into one facet region, [[https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/][lubridate]] to deal with dates
conversion, and [[https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/ggh4x][ggh4x]] to resize some panels with facets.

Run the snippet down below to download all:

#+begin_src shell :results output :exports both
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "cowplot", "DBI", "ggforce", "lubridate", "ggh4x"))
#+end_src
